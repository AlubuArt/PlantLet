We are developing a tool for managing a kitchen garden. The tool consists of a Java application and a MySQL database.

This is how you do:

Accept the email invitation to collaborate.

Clone this repository to your computer. For instructions using Netbeans watch this video from 10:44 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yukeBNBs3w

Set up the database 'kitchengarden' by running the sql script named DB_P8_Script.sql in MySQL Workbench.

Install the JDBC driver - google it! :)

Now you can run the Java application MyKitchenGarden.java that connects java with your local MySQL database and makes a query.
